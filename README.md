# ursif

## Main Repo

This is the parent of the `@ursif` monorepo. To install:

```
yarn // install deps
yarn run lerna bootstrap // install module deps
```

To Run:

```
yarn start // build services
```


You will now have to go into each `module` and run `yarn start`. _**Note**_: This is being actively worked on to be done during `docker-compose up`.
